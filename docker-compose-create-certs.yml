# This compose file is used to creaste the certificates used by the various components in the ELK stack
#
# If components are added to the main docker-compose.yml file, you must ensure there is the appropriaste certificates
# created for them in this file. Also check each Dockerfile to ensure any further processing is also correct.
#
# Once run, copy the certificate zip files from the target bind mount back into the project directory so that the building 
# of the images can work.
